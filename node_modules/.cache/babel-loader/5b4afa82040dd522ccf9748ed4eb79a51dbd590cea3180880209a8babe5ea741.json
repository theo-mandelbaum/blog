You're actually my last interview of the day.\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> Well hopefully you saved the best for last, haha.\n                <br />\n                <b>James:</b> I hope so! Let's get started. The first question here is going to be a basic distinction between data structures. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> Alright. A queue is a data structure that stores and accesses information following the FIFO principle, which means first in first out. Meanwhile, a stack stores information following the LIFO principle, meaning last in first out. The difference in the way that these data structures store data allows for them to be useful in different algorithms. For example, a queue is used when creating the algorithm for breadth-first search, while a stack is used for depth-first search.\n                <br />\n                <b>James:</b> Right, so how would you implement a queue using two stacks?\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> I've never actually solved this problem, so I can't tell you exactly how to do it. However, I know that it has something to do with using two stacks to effectively reverse the order of the data inputs.\n                <br />\n                <b>James:</b> You're actually on the right track here with the reversal idea. I appreciate that you're honest about not knowing, I'd rather hear you talk through your thinking than pretend to know something. That said, let's move on.<br />\n                At our company, we are integrating the use of AI for many of the smaller technical tasks. For the reason, we value knowledge and instincts surrounding software arechitecture. So, explain how you would choose between a relational database and non-relational database for a system.\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> I'm glad that you guys are implementing AI! I've done my own experimenting with AI tools and have found them extremely useful for my own projects. In terms of relational vs. non-relational databases, the first aspect of my system that I look at is how coupled the data is for said system, as a database with tightly couple attributes would likely require a relational database. Secondly, I look at the size of the system's required database, because a large database may lend itself to a non-relational database.\n                <br />\n                <b>James:</b> Good, I like that you mention coupling. Coupling is a very important topic when it comes to designing systems. To stay on AI, how do you see AI changing the role of software engineers or similar roles?\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> I think AI is going to take over a lot of the tedious work that engineers do, like writing boilerplate code or debugging simple issues. Where I don't think AI can take over is the design and architecture portion of engineering. Just like we were talking about with databases, someone still needs to understand the system well enough to tell the AI what to build. From my own experience, AI is great when you give it a clear, small task, but it struggles when you throw a vague, large problem at it. So, I think the engineers who can break down problems and review AI's code for optimization will thrive.\n                <br />\n                <b>James:</b> I agree with that. That's actually why we've been shifting our interview process to focus more on system design than coding puzzles. Alright Michael, that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> Yeah, what's your favorite part about working at the company?\n                <br />\n                <b>James:</b> Honestly, the team. Everyone here is willing to help each other out, and that makes a big difference when you're working on tough problems. Alright, well it was great talking to you Michael. We'll be in touch soon.\n                <br />\n                <b>Michael:</b> Sounds good, thanks for your time James. Have a good one!\n                <br />\n                *Zoom call ends*\n            </p>\n            <h2>Chain of Thought Prompting</h2>\n            <p>\n                In this transcript, I ask Claude to solve a problem regarding class scheduling.

Among these credits, I have three required courses with prerequisites. Each one must be taken after the other. Let's call them courses A, B, and C. So, course A must be taken before B, and B must be taken before C. Start by placing A in my first semester of the 3, then B in the following semester, and C in the final semester. I also have limited semester availability and fixed meeting times. I must complete minimum category requirements (upper-division, labs, writing). I can only attend classes starting after 12 pm on MWF and ending before 2 pm on TuTh. I must work at least 6 hours per week in contiguous blocks, with at least one work-only weekday. Minimize days on campus and avoid more than 3 consecutive class hours. The easiest way to isolate one day for work is by having no Friday classes. For each semester, block off friday as a no class, only work day. That way, I will have 75 minute classes ONLY on some combination of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n                <br />\n                LLM: This is a good framework.

The constraints and course availability create conflicts that prevent completing all lab prerequisites while maximizing credits.\n                <br />\n                Recommendation: Consult your advisor about additional course options that meet your time constraints (MW at or after 12pm, TuTh ending before 2pm, no Fridays) to fill the remaining 7 credits.\n                <br />\n                Would you like me to adjust any priorities (e.g., skip the lab sequence to fit more credits elsewhere)?\n                <br />\n                ---\n                <br />\n                Me: You're assuming that my semesters begin in the fall. They begin in the spring. Does that make it possible\n                <br />\n                LLM: Yes, that changes everything! Let me rework this.\n                <br />\n                Revised Semester Sequence\n                <br />\n                - Semester 1: Spring (Course B's prerequisite Course A must already be done... wait, that's a problem)\n                <br />\n                Actually, this creates a prerequisite issue:\n                <br />\n                - Course A (Fall only) then Course B (Spring only) then Course C (Fall only)\n                <br />\n                If you start in Spring, you can't take Course A until the following Fall. Let me re-examine:\n                <br />\n                - Semester 1 - Spring: Cannot take Course A (Fall only)\n                - Semester 2 - Fall: Take Course A\n                - Semester 3 - Spring: Take Course B\n                <br />\n                But then Course C (Fall only) can't be taken until a 4th semester.\n                <br />\n                This sequence is impossible in 3 semesters starting in Spring.\n                <br />\n                Unless - have you already completed Course A? If so:\n                <br />\n                - Semester 1 - Spring: Course B\n                - Semester 2 - Fall: Course C\n                - Semester 3 - Spring: Remaining courses\n                <br />\n                Does that match your situation? If you've already taken Course A, this works perfectly and actually opens up the schedule significantly. Please confirm and I'll build out the full plan.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default
