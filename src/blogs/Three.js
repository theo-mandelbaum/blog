            <h1>Shuky Meyer's Guest Visit and AI Essay</h1>
            <small>02-09-2026</small>
            <p>
                This week, I'll be giving my key takeaways from Shuky Meyer's visit as a guest speaker in our class. Along with that, I've been given Cory Doctorow's essay, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/18/tech-ai-bubble-burst-reverse-centaur" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Companies Will Fail</a>. After reading, I'll write my own response to the ideas in the essay.
